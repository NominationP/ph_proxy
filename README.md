[last repository](https://github.com/NominationP/py_proxy) , I use python , but now i'm work for PHP, I have to use PHP to work as soon as know more about PHP . Full day , I use PHP to complete one class(get_proxy) from curl , simple-html-dom , PHP syn ... I fount that's too complicated than python (include ";","$","{}"... or not have beautifulsoup !!! ....)


##description :
- use php
- curl
- [html-parser](https://github.com/bupt1987/html-parser/blob/master/README.md)


## current situation :
- get proxy ip from two url

##problem :

- if this project not well in your computer (I JUST KIDDING) , call me
    - reson: html-parser , I think it's better than simple-html-dom , much faster ,and that project use [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) , and I push github project not .ignore the /simhtmldorn
